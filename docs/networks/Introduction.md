# Introduction to Networking

A **computer network** is a collection of interconnected devices (hosts and peripherals) that communicate and share resources. Each host has a unique address, allowing data to be sent and received reliably. Networks can be small (LANs) or very large (the global Internet), enabling applications like web browsing, email, and file sharing. Today, almost every device is connected to a network for accessing services and data.

Networks consist of **nodes** (computers, routers, switches, wireless APs, etc.) and **links** (physical media such as copper cable, fiber, or wireless channels). The arrangement of these elements is called the network *topology*. For example, in a *star* topology all hosts connect to a central hub or switch, whereas in a *mesh* (fully connected) topology, multiple redundant links interconnect devices. Topology choice affects performance and reliability.

Networking enables sharing of resources: for instance, multiple computers can use the same printer or access the Internet through a shared gateway. Key network devices include **switches** (which forward frames within a LAN) and **routers** (which forward packets between networks). A router, much like a postal hub, directs traffic between networks to ensure each packet reaches its correct destination. Together, these components form the infrastructure of modern IT networks, making communication and data exchange possible and efficient.
