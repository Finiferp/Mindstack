Understanding OSI helps isolate functions for troubleshooting. Modern networks often use the TCP/IP model (Internet, Transport, Application layers), which roughly aligns with OSI layers.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"networks/Introduction":{"id":"networks/Introduction","title":"Introduction to Networking","description":"A computer network is a collection of interconnected devices (hosts and peripherals) that communicate and share resources. Each host has a unique address, allowing data to be sent and received reliably. Networks can be small (LANs) or very large (the global Internet), enabling applications like web browsing, email, and file sharing. Today, almost every device is connected to a network for accessing services and data.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"networks/IPServices":{"id":"networks/IPServices","title":"IP Services","description":"DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically provides IP addressing and configuration to hosts. A DHCP server leases an IP address, subnet mask, default gateway, and often DNS servers to a client. The typical client process is Discover \u2192 Offer \u2192 Request \u2192 ACK. On a Cisco router, you can configure a DHCP pool like:","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"networks/Routing":{"id":"networks/Routing","title":"Routing and IP Connectivity","description":"Routers operate at the Network layer, forwarding packets between different IP subnets. Static routes are manually configured (e.g. ip route 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0 192.168.1.2) to tell the router how to reach a network. Static routes are simple but do not adapt to failures, so dynamic routing protocols are used in larger or changing networks.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"networks/Security":{"id":"networks/Security","title":"Network Security Fundamentals","description":"Access Control Lists (ACLs) filter traffic at the router or switch. An ACL is a list of permit/deny rules applied to interfaces. Standard ACLs filter by source IP only, while extended ACLs can filter on source/destination IP, protocol, and port. For example:","sidebar":"docsSidebar"},"networks/Switching&LANs":{"id":"networks/Switching&LANs","title":"Switching and VLANs","description":"Switches operate at the Data Link layer to forward frames within a LAN. They learn which MAC addresses reside on which ports by examining incoming frames. Once learned, a switch forwards each frame only to the port of the destination MAC, greatly increasing efficiency compared to a hub. Each switch port defines its own collision domain, while the whole switch (by default) is a single broadcast domain.","sidebar":"docsSidebar"}}}}')}}]);
